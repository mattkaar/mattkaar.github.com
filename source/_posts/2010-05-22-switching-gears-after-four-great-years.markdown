I'm leaving my job at [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org) for a new one at [CERT](http://www.cert.org).

The decision wasn't an easy one. Four years ago, MITRE hired me straight out of [grad school](http://www.ini.cmu.edu) to help engineer cross domain solutions for the Government. Problem was, I'd never heard of a cross domain solution. Turns out, they're computers that connect different classified networks to help with information sharing.

I learned a ton about these systems - what they do, and what they don't do. Turns out, they have to be pretty secure - we are talking about national security after all. And along the way, I led a big deployment that'll help warfighters share information a lot easier.
 
Fast forward four years, and I'm ready for my next adventure. CERT needed a developer for their new [XNET exercise network](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/trifold.pdf) (pdf). I saw a new challenge and the opportunity to get back to development work. Oh, and Nat and I get to stay in the DC area (score!)
 
Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who made the past four years so memorable. If the next four are as exciting, I'll be one lucky guy.
