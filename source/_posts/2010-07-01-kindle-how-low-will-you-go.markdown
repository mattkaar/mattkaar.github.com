Oh Amazon, how you tempt meâ€¦

Yesterday, Woot announced they're getting acquired by Amazon. Now they have the latest Kindle for $150.

After devouring some great books on the Kindle recently, I really wanted to share them with Nat.  Buying physical copies could start to add up, so while writing this post, I broke down and bought a second Kindle.  Geek toys, you will be my downfall.

**UPDATE (9:24 AM ET):** Looks like it sold out.
