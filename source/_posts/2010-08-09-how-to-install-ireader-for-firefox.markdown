Mom, the last time I posted about Safari Reader you asked me if it's something you could use.

Since you're a Firefox user, you can't use that exact feature, but there's an add-on called iReader that works much the same way. By the way, Clark Howard uses Google Chrome now (I know you're a fan.)

But no worries, Firefox is still a fine browser. And here's my best attempt to walk you through installing something on your computer without logging in and doing it for you. :)

Here we go…

<!-- more -->

1. Click here → [iReader :: Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/195787/).  That will load a separate tab with this in it:

2. Click **Add to Firefox**.

3. A warning screen will appear.  You'll have to trust me on this one.  Click **Add to Firefox** again.

4. Firefox is really paranoid with warning you about software.  Read the text and click **Install Now**.

5. In order to enable the add-on, you've got to restart Firefox.  Luckily, there's a convenient **Restart Firefox** button in the next window that appears.  Click that button.

6. Finally surf to any long web article like this one.  You should see **a little 'R' icon** in the address bar.  Go ahead and click it.

7. Now enjoy easier reading and no ads.
