Being between jobs this week has me with free time, and my iPhone 3GS is burning a hole in my pocket right now.

I'd love to upgrade, but I'm not too keen on signing another contract with AT&T–service in the DC area isn't stellar.  And Nat's on Verizon (she gets free calls to her parents), and she's not leaving anytime soon. My money's on [Verizon getting the iPhone sometime this year](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Verizon-Executive-Calls-CDMA-iPhone-Inevitable-671780/), but I'll still be under contract for another six months at that point.

What's weird is that AT&T's offering to upgrade for only $18, even though I purchased my current phone less than a year ago. Used 3GS's are going for $350 on eBay, so I could upgrade for nothing and only have the contract to worry about. This is the dilemma, and not having a job to occupy my time isn't helping…
 
Thoughts?
 
**UPDATE:** Maybe I'll wait a little while, [things aren't exactly smooth sailing for AT&T today](http://gizmodo.com/5563909/).
 
**UPDATE 2:** Looks like [I waited too long…](http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/15/iphone-4-sold-out/)
