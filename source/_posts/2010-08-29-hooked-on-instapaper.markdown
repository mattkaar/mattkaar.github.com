If there's one browsing tool I like more than [Safari Reader](/blog/2010/07/27/single-minded-browsing-using-safari-reader)/[iReader](/blog/2010/08/09/how-to-install-ireader-for-firefox), it's [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com). Reading articles during the day drives me to distraction, and Instapaper allows me to save off interesting stuff for later consumption.

To get started, head over to [instapaper.com](http://instapaper.com) and register for an account. I recommend setting a password too, but it's not required. Then click and drag the **Read Later** button to the bookmarks bar in your browser (that's Chrome for Mac below.)

And that's it! When you stumble across a long web article, just click that Read Later bookmark. Once you have time to read, open up Instapaper and click the Text button next to each story â€” they'll show up without any annoying ads.

Finally, there's an iPad/iPhone app for when you're away from your computer. And Kindle owners can download all of their articles using the Kindle link on the right-hand side of the main site. So many options!
