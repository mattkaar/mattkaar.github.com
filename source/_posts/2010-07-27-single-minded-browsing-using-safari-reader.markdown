I'll admit it â€” I forward my fair share of web articles to family and friends. Unfortunately, with small font sizes and distracting ads, my eyes tire out quickly after page 3 of most long articles.

Enter the [new Reader button in Safari 5](http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader).

Reader displays an article's text in a readable font size and greys out the rest of the clutter.  It'll also consolidate multi-page articles to a single page.

For those not on Safari, the [iReader extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/195787/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ppelffpjgkifjfgnbaaldcehkpajlmbc) gives you the same clutter-free reading goodness.

Now when will they give us the same thing on the iPad??
